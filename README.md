## Overview
ParticlePlay is a small java application that uses a binary heap and a minimum priority queue to simulate perfectly elastic collisions of particles. The purpose of this project was to solidify my own understanding of the aformentioned data structures while having fun with the classic particle-in-a-[box] physics simulation.
